Think it's Better?

Vote on which is better, and bet if you're confident.  More points = better at knowing what's preferred among the other players.

This is a realtime multiplayer game that compares two things and observes players' reactions to them.
However, it does have highly relevant applications - marketing analytics to compare companies against their competitors, for example.  Another example is regional preferences - using IPs, track where people prefer certain products and act based on that knowledge.
Uses Node and Sockets.IO, and Bootstrap for CSS structuring.
